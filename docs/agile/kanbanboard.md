🔁 Solo Dev Flow Rule (Critical)
Never move a card directly from In Progress → Done

Everything must pass through Validate.

This single rule prevents:

Audit gaps

Migration bugs

“I’ll fix it later” debt

🏃 Solo‑Dev Sprint Rhythm (Lightweight)
Instead of formal sprints:

Weekly Focus Cycle
Monday: Select 1 Ready item → In Progress

Mid‑week: Validate early

Friday: Close or move to Risk

High‑Risk Work Rule
Excel & Email tasks only started when:

Schema is locked

Audit hooks exist

You have uninterrupted time
