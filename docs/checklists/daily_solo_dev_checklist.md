# ✅ Daily Solo Dev Checklist

---

## 🌅 Start of Day (5–10 minutes)

- [ ] Review Kanban board
- [ ] Confirm **only ONE** issue is in “In Progress”
- [ ] Re‑read the issue’s Goal and Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify the highest‑risk assumption for today
- [ ] Decide what “done today” means

---

## 🛠️ During Work

- [ ] Work only on the active issue
- [ ] Commit early and often (small commits)
- [ ] Keep schema changes deliberate and documented
- [ ] Add audit hooks immediately when touching writes
- [ ] Stop if you feel tempted to “just add one more thing”

---

## 🧪 Validation Before Stopping

- [ ] Feature works for the happy path
- [ ] Failure paths are visible (errors logged, surfaced)
- [ ] No silent data changes
- [ ] Audit behavior verified
- [ ] No schema drift without migration

---

## 🌙 End of Day (5 minutes)

- [ ] Move issue to **Validate** or **Done**
- [ ] Write 1–2 sentences in issue notes:
  - What changed
  - What surprised you
- [ ] Identify tomorrow’s single focus
- [ ] Stop — don’t “sneak in” extra work

---

## 🚨 Solo Dev Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

- One issue at a time
- No skipping validation
- No silent fixes
- No “future me will handle it”
